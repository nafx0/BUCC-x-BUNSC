---

## Tech Stack

### Frontend technologies

- Framework: React 18 + TypeScript
- Build tool: Vite 5
- Routing: React Router DOM
- Styling: Tailwind CSS (CSS variables + HSL token system)
- Component system: shadcn/ui patterns + Radix UI primitives
- Forms/validation utilities (available in dependencies): React Hook Form, Zod
- Icons: lucide-react
- UI feedback: Sonner + shadcn/ui Toaster
- Data fetching layer (available): @tanstack/react-query (QueryClient provided globally)

### Backend technologies

- Not included in this repository.
- The site currently runs as a static SPA; any dynamic features (forms, CMS, auth) would require an external backend.

### Database and storage

- Not included.
- Content and media are currently stored as static assets under the source tree.

### Third-party services and APIs

- Vercel Analytics (client-side analytics component).
- No other APIs/endpoints are currently called by the app.

---

## System Architecture

### High-level architecture

- Client-side rendered SPA hosted as static files.
- Routing handled in the browser; server must rewrite all routes to /index.html.

Conceptually:

```text
Browser
	└─ loads static assets (HTML/CSS/JS/images/video)
			 └─ React app mounts
						└─ React Router swaps page components
```

### Client–server interaction

- On first load, the host serves built static assets (generated by `vite build`).
- Navigation between pages is handled by React Router (no full page reload).
- The hosting platform must support SPA rewrites:
	- Vercel: configured via vercel.json rewrites.
	- Netlify (or similar): configured via public/_redirects.

### Data flow overview

- The app is content-driven and currently uses:
	- In-code curated data arrays (events, publications, panel members).
	- Static assets loaded via Vite’s bundling.
	- `import.meta.glob(..., { eager: true })` for galleries (build-time inclusion of images).
- Runtime state is local to the client (theme toggle, video modal states, lightbox selection).

---

## Folder & File Structure

### Major directories

- src/: Application source code
- src/pages/: Route-level pages (Home, About, Events, Publications, Media, Contact)
- src/components/: Shared layout and feature components (Navbar, Footer, carousels)
- src/components/ui/: shadcn/ui + Radix-based UI primitives
- src/assets/: Images and video used across pages (events/media folders)
- public/: Static public assets (hosted as-is) and SPA redirect rules

### Responsibilities of key files

- src/main.tsx: React root render + Vercel Analytics mount
- src/App.tsx: Global providers (ErrorBoundary, React Query, Tooltips, Toasts) + route table
- src/index.css: Design tokens (HSL variables), dark mode class, global utilities (glass, gradients)
- vite.config.ts: Dev server config + path alias (`@` → src) + lovable-tagger in development
- vercel.json: SPA rewrite configuration for Vercel
- public/_redirects: SPA rewrite configuration for Netlify-style hosting

---

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS recommended)
- One package manager:
	- npm (works out of the box)
	- bun (lockfile is present: bun.lockb)

### Environment setup

- No required environment variables for the current codebase.

### Installation steps

Using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Using bun:

```bash
bun install
```

### Running the project locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Dev server runs on `http://localhost:8080` (see vite.config.ts).

Build and preview:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

---

## Environment Variables

This project currently does not require any environment variables.

If you later add APIs (e.g., contact form submission, CMS, image hosting), use Vite’s convention:

- Prefix client-exposed variables with `VITE_`.
- Store them in `.env`, `.env.development`, `.env.production`.

Suggested future variables (not currently used):

- `VITE_API_BASE_URL`: Base URL for a backend service
- `VITE_CONTACT_FORM_ENDPOINT`: Endpoint for contact submissions
- `VITE_SENTRY_DSN`: Error monitoring DSN (client)

---

## Core Features Breakdown

### Navigation and routing

- Routes are defined in src/App.tsx and map directly to pages:
	- `/` → Home
	- `/about` → About
	- `/events` → Events
	- `/publications` → Publications
	- `/media` → Media
	- `/contact` → Contact
	- `*` → NotFound

User flow:

1. User lands on Home.
2. Uses Navbar links to navigate between pages.
3. Footer provides quick links and external social links.

### Home page (hero + intro video)

- Displays hero image and CTA buttons.
- “Watch Introduction” opens a fullscreen video view.
- Video can be minimized and restored; closing stops playback.

Business logic overview:

- Local state controls fullscreen/minimized state and play/pause.
- Uses refs to control video elements safely.

### Events

- Event metadata is curated in code.
- Each event card includes:
	- Category badge (color-coded)
	- Status badge
	- Representative image resolved from src/assets using `import.meta.glob`.

### Publications

- Blog cards and magazine cards are curated in code.
- Uses representative images from the assets folders.
- Intended as a static “publications showcase” (no CMS).

### Media gallery

- Loads images from src/assets via Vite glob import.
- Automatically groups images by folder name.
- Lightbox view opens on click; click outside closes.

### Contact

- Primary email contact via `mailto:`.
- Social links open in a new tab with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.

## API Documentation (If Applicable)

Not applicable for the current repository.

- There are no implemented HTTP endpoints.
- No authentication or authorization is implemented.

If you add a backend, document:

- Base URL, endpoints, request/response schemas, error formats.
- Auth mechanism (session/JWT/OAuth) and role model.

---

## UI/UX Behavior

### Navigation structure

- Fixed top Navbar with:
	- Active route highlighting
	- Mobile hamburger menu
	- Theme toggle

### Responsiveness

- Tailwind responsive classes are used throughout.
- Navigation collapses to a mobile menu on smaller screens.
- Grid layouts adapt across breakpoints (media gallery, events grid, footer columns).

### Accessibility considerations

- Images generally include alt text.
- External links use safe target/rel attributes.

Recommended improvements:

- Ensure all interactive elements have visible focus states.
- Add keyboard support for lightbox close (Escape key) and video modal focus trapping.
- Prefer semantic buttons over clickable divs where possible.

---

## Error Handling & Edge Cases

### Common errors

- Unknown routes → NotFound page.
- Runtime React errors → ErrorBoundary fallback UI.

### Fail-safe mechanisms

- ErrorBoundary prevents a full blank screen by rendering a recovery view.
- The “Go to Home” action in ErrorBoundary forces a clean navigation.

Edge cases to consider:

- Missing/invalid media assets: currently not surfaced to the user (images may render broken).
- Very large asset folders: eager imports may increase build size and memory usage.

---

## Performance & Optimization

### Caching strategies

- Static hosting platforms (Vercel/Netlify) can cache immutable build assets.
- Prefer long-cache headers for hashed JS/CSS assets (handled by most static hosts).

### Lazy loading / code splitting

- Current routes are imported eagerly in src/App.tsx.
- Recommended: route-level lazy loading using `React.lazy()` + `Suspense` for large pages.

### Optimization techniques used

- Vite build pipeline (tree-shaking, minification).
- Tailwind CSS utility generation + production purge.

Potential improvements (if needed):

- Change `import.meta.glob(..., { eager: true })` to non-eager loading for galleries.
- Add image optimization pipeline (modern formats, responsive sizing).

---

## Security Considerations

### Authentication flow

- Not implemented (public site).

### Data validation

- No server-side input handling exists in this repo.
- Client-side validation libraries (Zod/React Hook Form) are available if forms are added.

### Security best practices implemented

- External links opened in a new tab typically use `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.
- No secrets are stored in code; no env vars required.

Recommended practices for production:

- Add a Content Security Policy (CSP) via hosting headers.
- Avoid committing any future API keys into the repo; use environment variables.

---

## Deployment

### Deployment platform

- This repo is configured for SPA hosting on:
	- Vercel via vercel.json
	- Netlify-style hosting via public/_redirects

### Build process

- Build command: `npm run build`
- Output directory: Vite default (`dist/`)

### CI/CD overview (if any)

- No CI/CD pipelines are included in this repository.
- Suggested: GitHub Actions to run `npm ci`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build` on pull requests.

---

## Maintenance & Scalability

### Code extensibility

- Pages are cleanly separated under src/pages.
- UI primitives are centralized under src/components/ui.
- React Query is already set up globally, enabling future API integration without rewiring providers.

### Future improvement suggestions

- Add a CMS or structured content source for events/publications.
- Add a backend (or serverless function) for contact submissions.
- Add route-level code splitting and non-eager gallery loading.
- Persist theme preference (localStorage) to maintain user choice.
- Add automated image optimization and responsive sources.

---

## Known Limitations

### Current constraints

- Content is hard-coded in the frontend (events/publications/panel member data).
- No backend, database, or admin tooling is present.
- Gallery imports are eager; large media libraries can increase build size.
- Theme toggle state is not persisted across reloads.

### Planned enhancements (recommended)

- Introduce a content management approach (CMS or JSON-based content pipeline).
- Add analytics events for key CTAs (beyond base page analytics).
- Add accessibility enhancements for modals/lightboxes.

---

## Notes for Maintainers

- If you add environment variables, prefer Vite’s `VITE_` prefix and document them in this README.
- Keep design tokens in src/index.css; avoid hard-coding colors in components.
- Ensure hosting always rewrites unknown routes to /index.html for SPA navigation.
